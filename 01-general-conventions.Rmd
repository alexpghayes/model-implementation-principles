# General Conventions

* Code should follow the [tidyverse style conventions](http://style.tidyverse.org/)

* All results must be reproducible from run-to-run.

<div id="messages-back"></div>

* If there is a strong need for producing output during execution, there should be a `verbose` option that defaults to no output. [{notes}](#messages)
