# General Conventions

* Function names should use snake_case instead of camelCase.

* All functions must be reproducible from run-to-run.

<div id="messages-back"></div>

* If there is a strong need for producing output during execution, there should be a `verbose` option that defaults to no output. [{notes}](#messages)

* When parallelism is used: 

    * Provide an argument to specify the amount (e.g. number of cores if appropriate) and default the function to run sequentially. 

    * Computations should be easily reproducible, even when run in parallel. Parallelism should not be an excuse for irreproducibility.
